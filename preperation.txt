It seems like your house will be flooded! No need to worry, we have prepared a checklist for your and your family's safety:
1. Create a flood plan
   First and foremost you need a simple but effective plan to follow when the flood happens.
   Your plan should include an efficient route to the nearest emergency evacuation center
   while you gather all your valuables and supplies.
   All your household must agree on the plan, otherwise it doesn't mean anything!

2. Prepare an emergency kit ASAP
   It should contain at the very least:
      + 3 days' worth food and drink supplies per person
      + First aid and medication kit
      + Flashlight and a radio with spare batteries (don't forget to put them in a waterproof bag!)
      + Warm clothing and blankets
      + Important documents, keys and some cash
